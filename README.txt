Group Name: Co-Shooter

Group Members: Connor West, Harsh Kothari, Matthew Mohaupt

Brief game idea: The host player will be presented questions on a billboard and will be given the opportunity to answer by shooting the correct answer. The second player will cooperate with the first player by sharing hints that the second player finds within their area. Once the questions are answered correctly the players can steal the gold!

Player Interaction Pattern: Cooperative play

Objective: Solution
Serious Objective: Educate players about CPU architecture

Procedures: Players will be communicating with each other with hints to solve questions and shoot the right answers

Rules: Only one player can see the hints and one can shoot.

Resources: Limited by your own knowledge of the concepts and hints

Non-plain-vanilla procedure/rule: Players must communicate outside of the game (In person/Over call)

Test Question for Serious Objective: What is a CPU?

Expected Correct Answer for Serious Objective: Central Processing Unit

New readme just for hw4

New physics objects: Added two rocks, one very heavy and one not too heavy, both have a high dynamic friction so the first push is hard and a slightly lower static friction as once the rock is in motion its easier to push, the bigger rock blocks the path to hint area and the smaller rock blocks the hint that is on the ground

New light objects: Added a new area light to brighten up the game instead of it being in shadows like it was originally with a warm field, added a red lamp to shine on the fake wall to give players a hint that, that is where the red glowing mushrooms are leading them to.

New billboard with texture: Added a billboard on the rock telling players it can be pushed so they know to go in there, as well giving it a metallic texture so it looks like it was attached to the rock by others
